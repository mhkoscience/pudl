# Search engine pudl

In two COVID-19 semesters, more than 1000 educational videos was recorder
at the Department of physical chemistry, University of Chemistry and Technology
in Prague, Czech Republic. Since the beginning, it has been tricky to orient
among them, so we created a search engine. Inspired by Goethe's 
"Das war also des Pudels Kern!" ([Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/des_Pudels_Kern)),
we call it pudl and host it on [pudl.vscht.cz](https://pudl.vscht.cz).

This repository contains the website code.
